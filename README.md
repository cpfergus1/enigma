This enigma cipher program will encrypt any length of message by shifting letters based on four seperate keys. In addition, this program will allow you to decode the message and crack it if necessary. 

Self grading rubric:
Functionality - program follows interaction pattern and successfully encrypts/decrypts/cracks from the CLI interface. Brute force method produced another key that was applicable in decoding the interaction pattern message (same shift parameters, documented in enigma test) but I have found no issues with the solution. "3.8"

Object Oriented Programming - Project has been broken down into what I believe are logical compenents and are properly encasulated. No class is too little and specific to job. All classes handle specific functionality. No use of modules or inheritance. "3"

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - All code is properly indented, naming conventions are clear and communicate purpose (as far as I know). All enumerables were chosen as best fit answers to solve a particular problem, However I am sure there are others that may be in mind. Only 1 method is 12 lines due to the return value hash length and was left that way for readibility. "3.5"

Test Driven Development - Every Method has been tested in multiple ways to account for multiple possiblities and outcomes. Commits show test were created before wrighting code. Four stubs were utilized in tests to test functionality but is limited in scope. "3"

Version Control - 50+ commits were implemented and most pull requests included logical chunks of functionality. All pull requests are clearly and concisely documents for purpose of pull request. No more than 3 commits included multiple pieces of functionality, but during refactoring, multiple lines of code were moved inbetween commits. "3"
